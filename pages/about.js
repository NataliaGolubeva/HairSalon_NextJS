              The world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. People
              don’t just randomly drop into a new salon to see if it’s right for
              them anymore.

              I’m sure you’ve researched restaurants on Google, Instagram,
              Facebook, and Yelp before booking a dinner when you’ve arrived in
              a new place. And course people are doing even more research on
              where to go for a haircut and style!

              I work on my own for the past eight years and have 15 years of
              color and styling experience. I specialize in unique highlighting
              techniques, such as balayage and "babylights". I'm trained and
              certified in multiple color systems and enjoy using my knowledge
              to create exactly what my clients are envisioning when they sit
              down in my chair.
